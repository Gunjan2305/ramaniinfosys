        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect information to provide better services to all our users—from figuring out basic stuff like which
            language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful or which services matter
            most to you.</p>
        <ul>

                visit our website.</li>
            <li><strong>Project Data:</strong> Information related to your project requirements, including
